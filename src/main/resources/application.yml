# general time parameters
# -> fps (int): How many records/frames is one second
# -> skip-seconds (double): How many seconds are skipped at the beginning of the measurement
time:
  fps: 50
  skip-seconds: 1.0

# calibration data for the time-series analysis
# -> num_frames (int): How many frames are considered for an observation
# -> threshold (double): Determines when a change in the series is significant (above) or treated as irrelevant / noise (below)
# -> buffer-seconds (double): How many seconds buffer until a neutral edge is accepted. This merges separate movements as one,
#    so care where to set it. If this is not present, there is no buffering (same as setting it to 0 explicitly)
detectors:
  palmX:
    num_frames: 40
    threshold: 30.0
    buffer-seconds: 0.5
  palmY:
    num_frames: 40
    threshold: 30.0

# Threshold for classification of frequency
# Two values per motion:
# -> low: Max number of motions per second the be regarded as LOW frequency
# -> medium: Max number of motions per second the be regarded as MEDIUM frequency
# -> high: Max number of motions per second the be regarded as HIGH frequency
#          All values above high will be recognized as RANDOM
motion:
  move-vertical:
    low: 0.7
    medium: 1
    high: 3
  counter-move-horizontal:
    low: 3
    medium: 8
    high: 15
